##  ENGG Projects (Selected)

### 🔹 Automatic Survey Machine (2025) - MINOR PROJECT
🔗 https://github.com/milanbhat1/automatic-survey-machine  
Developed a low-cost autonomous survey robot integrating ultrasonic-based obstacle detection, DC motor control, and real-time gyroscope data acquisition. The system visualizes terrain orientation through a live web dashboard using WebSockets and Plotly, enabling real-time motion and slope analysis.

---

### 🔹 QAM Modulation and Demodulation using ESP32 (2025)
🔗 https://github.com/milanbhat1/16qam_esp32 
Implemented a 16-QAM digital communication system using two ESP32 microcontrollers. The project performs bit-to-symbol mapping, I–Q based modulation, wireless transmission using ESP-NOW, and nearest-neighbor demodulation at the receiver, providing a practical realization of communication system theory.

---

### 🔹 Cardio Track – Low Power ECG Signal Acquisition System (2025)
🔗 https://github.com/milanbhat1/low-power-ecg-circuit  
Designed, simulated, and implemented a low-power analog ECG signal acquisition system capable of capturing clear P, QRS, and T waveforms. The project focuses on low-noise amplification, filtering, and real-time hardware validation for biomedical applications.

---

### 🔹 IoT-Based Smart Door Security & Monitoring System (2025)
🔗 https://github.com/milanbhat1/iot-door-security-system  
Developed an ESP8266-based smart door system with password-protected access, real-time presence detection, and instant Telegram alerts. The system integrates a web-based UI, sensors, and automated security logic for remote monitoring.

---

### 🔹 FIFO Block Design using Verilog HDL (2025)
🔗 https://github.com/milanbhat1/FIFO  
Designed and simulated a synchronous FIFO architecture using Verilog HDL. The project emphasizes reliable data transfer, hazard-free read/write operations, and clean modular design suitable for digital and VLSI applications.

---

### 🔹 Battery Management System (BMS) using STM32 (2025)
🔗 https://github.com/milanbhat1/BatteryManagementSystem-STM32  
Developed a Battery Management System that monitors battery voltage and current, estimates State of Charge (SOC), and provides real-time visualization on an OLED display. The system includes protection logic with audible and visual alerts during low SOC and abnormal current conditions.
